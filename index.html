      <h2>How people say about this service </h2>

      <p>Excellent experience! They were very nice with us…we rent 7 bikes for the all day but after 2 hours it started to rain so we brought the bikes back. As compensation they allowed us to do 4 more hours rental for free on a day of our choice…so very kind and nice. We really appreciated! And the bikes were also very comfortable. I highly recommend this rental bike. Thank you once more! </p>
